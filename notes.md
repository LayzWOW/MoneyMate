### Register / Login
- The Login / Register page is working as expected. 
- The "login with" using Facebook/Google/Apple does not work because it is not implemented yet.
- Whereas, the sign up side, it works fine

### Dashboard
- Some of the features are not added due to time constraints
- the goals section works as intended
- quick options (not really)

### Features
1) Added the Light/Dark mode toggle for the whole website
    - The toggle is located at the top right corner of the website
    - It is a button that toggles between light and dark mode
    - Feature added so you won't be f**king blind while looking at the screen at night

### Some considerations
- The website is not responsive on mobile devices
- The notification system is not implemented yet, but it will be in the future for the end product
- The quick options is not implemented yet, due to the intricacy of the feature, but will be added sooner
- The goals section doesn't work rather showned as a placeholder and does not work at all, will be fixed sooner
- Categories doesn't work, will be fixed sooner, placed as a dummy

### Database
- The database is not implemented yet, but it will be in the future for the end product

# If you are reading this, it means you are the chosen one to fix this website, good luck
# And this is made in one day, give me a week, and you'll have a fully functioning website
# By the way, please ignore the fact that all decorative elements are in the style.css, it's a mess, I know. I am in a rush
